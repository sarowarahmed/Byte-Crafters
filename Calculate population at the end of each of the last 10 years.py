#The current population of a town is 10000. The population of the town is increasing at the rate of 10% per year. You have to write a program to find out the population at the end of each of the last 10 years. For eg current population is 10000 so the output should be like this:
#10th year - 10000
#9th year - 9000
#8th year - 8100 and so on

population = 10000
for year in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(f"{year}th year - {population}")
    population = population / 1.1
